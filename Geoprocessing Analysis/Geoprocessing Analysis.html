<h1>Homework 10: Geoprocessing Analysis </h1>
<h2>Colin Anderson</h2>
<h3>The question that I asked was about how much of California was within 25 miles of a National Park.
    This data can be used when combined with census data to determine the number of people within a certain distance to a National Park, or combined with a road map to show how close major roadways are to the parks.
    To start, I took the shapefile for National Parks and made an intersect with the California shapefile, which should have left all the parks in California selected.
    However, Joshua Tree National Park was excluded from this intersect, despite being entirely within California's boundaries.
    To try to fix this, I first downloaded a different California shapefile, but I ran into the same problem.
    I instead selected only Joshua Tree National Park, made it its own layer, then merged it with the previously made intersect.
    I then created a buffer of 25 miles around the parks to show how much of California was within that range.
    Then, as some area was outside of California's boundaries, I made a second intersect, leaving only the area within 25 miles of a National Park that was within California.
    For the creation of the map, I left California's boundaries visible as it provides a point of reference for what would have appeared to be disconnected blobs.
    I also left the park locations visible too, as I intentionally cut off some of the buffer area around them, and without having them, the buffer zone would appear inaccurate.
