<h1>Homework 9: Make a Choropleth </h1>
<h2>Colin Anderson</h2>
<h3>This map shows the number of recrational visitors to National Parks and other areas cared for by the National Park Service during 2019.
    The most visited states share one of two characteristics: They either have many parks or they have one, major park, and with California having both.
    I chose visitation by state instead of by park due to small size of the protected areas compared to the rest of the United States, making it almost impossible to see each area, let alone identify it.
    I also chose the visitation in 2019 rather than 2020 due to the impact Covid-19 had on park visitation.  I wanted to show visitation to parks under normal circumstances, rather than the nearly universal decrease that occurred in 2020.
    Of note, Delaware does not have any data as there are no areas protected by the National Park Service in Delaware.
